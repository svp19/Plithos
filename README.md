# People Detection using TensorFlow

The program aims at seeing how useful the pre-trained model from tensorflow : ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17 can be 
to count the number of people in a variety of places ranging from Public restaurants to crowded market places.

Results for some simple images shown in test_images.  This project is still a work in progress and more info may be
found below section. 
#### Future Scope

Transfer learning may be performed to improve the head count in crowded places and the model may be used to estimate the
growth rate of number of people in crowded places which is an essential parameter in crowd control analysis. The model
may also be deployed for queue analysis to estimate waiting times for users.
